If we make the grid like any of the below two cases then we can satisfy the given condition -  
1) 1 0 1e10 .....
   0 ............
   ..............
2) 1 0 ..........
   0 ............
   1e10 .........
   ..............

For either of these 2 cases, one of the sides has to be at least 3 units long and the other one has to be atleast 2 units long. So we just need to check for this condition.
