So lets say there are two categories of elements with frequencies n and m respectively. So if you perform an operation on any element of lets say category 1, then its frequenct becomes m+1 and the other's becomes n-1 and vice versa. So if you dry run a lot of testcases we will see that, when there are even zeroes - we will first perform an operation on any 0, then any 1 and so on. The indices will be that of the 0s in the original string as the bits flip with every operation. Similarly, when there are odd ones - we will start with a 1 and follow the same pattern. The only case when we can't convert the string is when there are odd zeroes and even ones. And obviously if the string is already all zeroes, then we don't need to perform any operation.
