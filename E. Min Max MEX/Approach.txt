So basically we need to ensure that all the partitions have a minimum mex. So binary search can be used to iterate through all possible values of the mex that can be set. But before that we need to find a way to check if a particular mex value can be set or not. So for a segment's mex to be x it needs to contain all the values from 0-x-1 at least once within it. So to maintain a minimum mex value of x across all the k segments we need to have at least k segments of 0-x-1 within the array. So we can use a frequency array/set where we would insert the values less than x and when it becomes full we will update our count and reset all the values and start again. If this final count is more than or equal to k, we can set this value. So using this binary search can be implemented here. In this problem, we should use a frequency array instead of a set to avoid overhead because otherwise it is giving tle.
