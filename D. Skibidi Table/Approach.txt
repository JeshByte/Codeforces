Knowing the level of the question, its obvious that it won't be a pattern based one. We can think of a recursive solution where we divide the table to smaller sizes. For example, the table's size is 2^n*2^n and I need to find the value at (x,y). So, I will start with my value as 1(as it's the starting value). Then I will try to find out in which 2^(n-1)*2^(n-1) block this coordinate lies. Then on the basis of that I will adjust the coordinates and my starting value. This will go on till I reach a 2*2 block where I can manually find the values. We will have to take a similar approach to find the coordinates for a given number.
