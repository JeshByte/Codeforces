Here the final answer will be of the form a+b+c where a is a prefix of s, c is a suffix of t and b is a common substring between s and t. Now if we dry run through various test cases we can see that b can always be of length 1. So we just need to go through all the characters and see if they are common between the strings and see if they give the minimum length or not.
