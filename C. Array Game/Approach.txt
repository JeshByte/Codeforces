Here there will be three cases - 
1) If k>=3, then we can take any two elements ai and aj. We will generate ai-aj in the first k-1 operations. In the kth operation we will take any 2 of the ai-aj and generate 0.
2) If k=1, the final answer will either be one of the original elements or the new element. So we can just find the minimum out of the original elements and all the possible differences in N^2 time.
3) If k=2, the final answer can be the minimum original element or the minimum difference or the minimum second difference. The second difference can be generated with or without the first difference. If it is generated without it, it is equivalent to the first difference. So for this we will only consider the case of using the first difference. For that we can run a N^2 loop to generate all the possible first differences. Then for each first difference we need to see how we can make the lowest second difference using it. For that we can either subtract the greatest element <= it from it or subtract it from the lowest element >= it. We can find these elements using lower bound function. We just need to find the minimum out of all of these cases. This can be done in N^2*logN.
