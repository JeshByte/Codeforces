So first we should handle the case of the entire string consisting of 1s, for which the answer would be 0. Now doing a single operation of cost k is same as doing k operations of cost 1. So we will only focus on operations of cost 1 to make it easier to assess. Now if dry run the operation a few times, we will notice that in each operation every subarray consisting of 0s gets reduced by 1 simultaneously. Here we need to consider the subarrays in a cyclic way as our operation is also cyclic in nature. Thus the no of operations needed will be the max length of any subarray consisting of all 0s in the given string.
