We have to modify F such that if there is any path between 2 nodes in G, then only there would be a path between those nodes in F. So basically we have to ensure that the components of both the graph is same. So we can first find all the components in G. Then if there any edges in F between 2 nodes which are from different components in G we will remove them. Then the components in F that will remain will only have points that are also in the same component in G. But there still might be some components that don't have a path between them even though they do in G. So basically we will have to merge these components by adding an edge between any 2 vertices from the 2 components. The number of these operations needed is simply going to be the difference between the number of components of F and G. By adding them both up, we will get our final answer. We will have to use DSU here to find the components efficiently.
