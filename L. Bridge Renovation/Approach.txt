So as we have to create a fixed tuple of (n,n,n) here we can go for a greedy fixed optimal strategy for all n's. So for every length,we will use the tuple which has most of that value. For 25, 25+25 is optimal. So we take  floor(n/2) of that. For 21, 21+21+18 is optimal. So we take floor(n/2) of that. So we still need to collect n%2 more for these lengths. So here the 25+21 combination is optimal. So in total for 25 and 21 we just need n plancks. Now through this we would have also collected floor(n/2) plancks of 18. We need more ceil(n/2) plancks. 18+18+18 is the most optimal. So we will need to take ceil(n/6) plancks for that. Thus the final answer is n+ceil(n/6).
