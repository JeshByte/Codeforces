Through the operations we can see that we can convert a number to any of the required numbers. So if we can go through all the numbers and change them one by one without affecting the previously changed numbers then we can obtain our answer. We can see that for an a[i][j], if we apply the operations on a[i][j+1], a[i+1][j] and a[i+1][j+1] then we can change all the numbers except for the ones in the last row and column. After performing the operations in the other rows and columns, the numbers in the last ones have to be same. If they are not we can't get our answer because making any change to those numbers means we will have to change some of the already equal numbers.
