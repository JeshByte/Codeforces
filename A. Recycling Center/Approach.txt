So, first of all the constraints allow a n^2 solution. According to the problem statement, at any point of time the best choice would be to destroy the trash bag with the largest weight that is <= c. This is because if you destroy something heavier, it would anyways cost you a coin and the rest of the weights get doubled. So this bag which could have been destroyed for free can now potentially cost you a coin after its weight gets doubled. On the other hand, if you destroy something lighter, it would be free but as the rest of the weights get doubled the heavier bag which was still <=c may now potentially cost you a coin. Instead if you chose the bag that I described then there is a higher chance of the lighter bags still being <=c after the doubling. So the optimal strategy would be to choose these bags if available. After that pick the remaining bags using 1 coin each thus the total cost will be the number of such remaining bags. As n^2 is allowed, just use brute force and simulate this to get the answer.
