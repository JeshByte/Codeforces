So for each kid, we have 2 choices - give them the money directly or buy them the present. Now if we are going to buy a present it makes sense to go for the cheapest one. But if we look at the kids, it would be optimal to try to assign presents to the kids with higher indices. This is because higher index means the amount of money to be given to them is higher. So we should try to focus on these kids first and try to give them the cheapest gifts possible. So we will first sort that array in descending order. Then for each kid, we will check what would be cheaper to give them - the gift or the money directly and then update our answer/cost accordingly.
