The answer here is monotonic i.e. if n is possible then n+1,n+2,... and so on are also possible. Thus we can use binary search here. Our check function here would use math to greedily check whether putting desks as per the current bench size would make it possible to seat atleast k students. If yes then the answer is valid and we would check for a smaller answer. If not we will go for a bigger answer. Another hint for the binary search approach here was the fact that all the given values were <=1e9, making it obvious that we would need a logarithmic time complexity for this problem.
