Here in this version of the problem, the first array will be just the n-1 elements given and an extra 1. So basically here we need to create pairs of elements which follow this condition. The number of elements who couldn't be paired is also the number of operations needed. Now as we are dealing with comparing values of elements in 2 different arrays, we should sort them first(in ascending). So for one given element, if we can pair it with an element then we can also pair it with the elements to its right as the arrays are sorted. But we will always want to pair with the leftmost ones as it would give us a better chance of pairing for the other elements. So here we will just use a 2 pointer approach on the 2 sorted arrays to pair the elements one by one from array a to the leftmost possible elements in array b. The ones who couldn't be paired are the ones to be deleted and thus gives us our answer.
