Here we need to find numbers which are only divisible by double digit or bigger primes. So we just need to find numbers which are not divisible by any single digit prime which is easy because there are only 4 such primes - 2,3,5,7. So we can use the inclusion exclusion principle here to find the numbers that are divisble by 2 or 3 or 5 or 7 and subtract that from the total number of values. The formula for this will be - adding the number of values divisible by just 2,3,5,7; subtracting number of values divisible by the all the pairs(we will need to use the lcm of each pair); and so on. This can be done manually or we can use bitmasking to create all the combinations.
