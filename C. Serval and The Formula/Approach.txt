If we go through the binary representations of different test cases we can see that this will only be possible if there are no overlapping ones in their bits. This can't be possible for any k if x=y(as already given in the sample test cases). An easy way to achieve this is to turn the bigger number to a power of 2. Then the larger number would turn to a power of 2 while the other number would still be a smaller number compared to it. We can see that in this case there would never be any overlapping ones. As k's bounds are pretty big we can always easily find a possible answer with this method.
