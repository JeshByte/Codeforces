In the case of odd length string, the initial string is starting and ending both with a. In that case the first letter cant be b. After the first deletion the case of both odd and even will become equivalent. Then if we dry run a few test cases, we will see that when we choose say a, the next letter has to be b. After that we again get the choice between the two letters. This ultimately reduces to the fact that s[i]=s[i+1] for every alternate i. So after handling the case of odd length, we just need to check with this condition while handling the '?'s.
