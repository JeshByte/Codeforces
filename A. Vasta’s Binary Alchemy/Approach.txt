Here we need to extract a subsequence such that the sequence itself is increasing and the remaining sequence is palindromic. As an empty sequence is considered both increasing and palindromic, the easiest way to do this is to extract all the available 0s from the string. Then the extracted string will be empty or all 0s and the remaining string will be all empty or all 1s. In all the cases, the condition will be satisfied.
