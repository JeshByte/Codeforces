We can see that if we add only 9 to any number we can get number 7 within atmost 9 operations. So the answer will never go beyond that. So when adding say 9 to a number, there is not point in adding 99. Because then it will be optimal to add 99 only. So it can be observed that only adding one particular number(even that we don't need to do more than 9 times) is enough to get the optimal solution. So just precompute all the possible 'allowed' numbers and then check for each number to find the minimum operations needed.
