So lets say we are at height x. Using math we can see that we can reach a maximum height of x+(x-w+1) where w is the water level at the time of teleportation. Also there is no use in going to a lower tower because we will be going further away from the tallest tower and the water level will also increase making things more difficult for us. So now we just need to find the max height we can reach from the present tower using the above formula and then greedily go to the tower that is closest to that height and so on. To do this in O(n) we will need to sort the array and we can do so because the indices don't matter here and we will always try to reach a higher tower. If we reach the tower, then the answer is yes. But if we reach a point where we can't go to the next tower because its beyond our limit then that means we can't reach the tallest tower and the answer is no.
