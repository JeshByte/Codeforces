When you are moving a digit(say si) to the left, you can move it at most si times. This is because everytime you move it, it's value is decreased by one. So if once it becomes 0, you won't be able to move it anymore. So on a higher level all the shifts that need to made throughout the string will be quite less compared to the string's length(especially when |s| goes till 1e5). Thus, you can simply use a brute force approach to solve this question as practically the time complexity will always remain well within the time constraints.
