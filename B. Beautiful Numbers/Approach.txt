The only way a number would be beautiful is when the sum of is digits are <=9. Thus we need to reduce its sum as much as possible with every operation. If we replace a digit with 0, we effectively reduce the sum by the value of its digit. So it makes sense to greedily remove the biggest digits till the sum becomes <=9. The only caveat here is we can't convert the leftmost digit to 0 as there can't be any leading zeroes. So the lowest we can convert it to is 1. So the contribution of this one digit will be val(digit)-1 while that of others will be just val(digit). So just greedily pick the highest one in each operation. In this way the no of operations will always be optimal.
