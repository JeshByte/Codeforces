So the first element would never be deleted as you can't find an element to its left that is greater than it. Another observation is that if there is a subarray of size k whose first element is its max element, you would be able to delete all of its k-1 elements besides the first one. Combining these 2 observations - we just need to start from the 2nd element, comparing each of them with our current maxi(which initially would be the 1st element). If the new element is smaller than our maxi, we would increment our answer or else this element would now be our new maxi and we will then compare the remaining elements with it till we again find a new maxi.
