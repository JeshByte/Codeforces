If we look at it on a binary level, whenever we perform this operation on a subsequence we basically remove all of its common set bits from all the numbers in that subsequence. So our k should be such that we can divide the set bits at each position into k sized groups for each operation. In other words k must divide the number of set bits in each position. Thus the max possible value of k would be the gcd of the number of set bits at each position. Now for the other possible values, they must also divide k. So basically our final answer would be all the factors of this max possible k(including k itself).
