The top level will have 2 cards, the next one 4, the next one 6, and so on. So the number should be such that you can sum it up through this series. As n is <=1e5, and the value being added continously increases we can estimate that it won't take that many iterations to confirm whether n is valid or not. So we will just brute force it where if n is valid, h would be the no of iterations.
