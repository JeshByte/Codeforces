So, our answer can be at most n*k(I am using k instead of m). Lets say our answer is in the form of a*10^r where r is roundness of the number. So a*10^r<=n*k. r will go till log10(n*k) which in this question will go at most till 18. Thus we can check for each value of r. Now lets focus on a. For a given r, we need to find the max a such that it is <=floor((n*k)/(10^r))(lets call this value const) and a*10^r is divisible by n. For the second condition to happen a has to be of the form m*L where L is n/gcd(n,10^r) and m is any positive integer. So after finding L we need to find max m such that m*L<=const. Thus m=floor(const/L). So for a particular r, the most optimal answer is 10^r*m*L. We will find all these optimal values for each possible r and then find the best out of them - which would be our final solution. This whole solution will take log10(n*k) time.
