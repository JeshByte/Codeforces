m can be represented as 2^c1+2^c2+... and so on. s also needs to be represented using the same powers of 2 but the coefficients can be anything. So s=k1*2^c1+k2*2^c2+... and so on. This can be reduced to s=2^c*R where c is the lsb of m. Thus the only case where s cant be created is when it is not divisible by the lsb of m. Now lets see how to make s. So we have seen above how the entire s needs to be created using the same powers of 2 in the entire m. This is also true for each prefix of m and s. Lets say the current prefix of m is 2^c1+2^c2. And lets say the current prefix of s of value v can be shown using these same powers like this v=k1*2^c1+k2*2^c2. Lets say here k=max(k1,k2). This means some bit/power of 2 in this prefix needs to be there at least k times. Thus we just need to find this k for each prefix of m and s. The max k will be our answer.
