In a tower, you just have to check the base box. If it can handle the boxes above it, the other boxes are ok too as they all have the same durability but the boxes decrease as we go up. So the base box can handle at most (d/m) boxes. So each tower can have at most total=(d/m)+1 boxes. The +1 is to account for the box at the bottom. So if we can put these many boxes in each tower, the minimum no of towers would be Ceil(n/total).
