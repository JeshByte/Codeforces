So we need to minimise the maximum penalty. We can use binary search here with the range being the array given to us in a sorted manner with only distinct values. These will act as the possible maximum penalty we will try to  maintain. Now for each value, we can just go through the string where we will paint through a red or a blue when it's penalty is <= mid to check whether this particular value is a possible answer or not.
