Lets consider the case of when y is +ve. Then we need to make at least y no of moves of 1st type. Then we will see where our x is. If our current x is beyond the target x, its not possible to reach it anymore as none of the moves reduce our x. So in that case answer is -1. On the otherhand, if we still have more to go then the rest of our moves need to be of type 2 or a combo of type 1 and type 3 so that we dont disturb the y coordinate anymore. Thus the remaining distance till target x has to be of the form 3c1+6c2(6 is for the combo move of type 1 and 3). This reduces to 3c. Thus the remaining distance has to be divisible by 3 for it to be feasible. The case for -ve y is same, just the first y moves have to be of 3rd type. The rest of the logic will remain same.
