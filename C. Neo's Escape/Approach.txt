A particular clone covers a certain subarray in the array. So the first intuition is to divide the array into parts such that each part is handled by a clone. Now a clone will be able to handle a part only if from the starting position elements to the left and right of it are smaller than it in a sorted manner. For example in 1,7,9,7,1; here if we start from 9 the clone will have to first go to 7 and then to 1 which is possible but on the other hand if it were like 7,1,9,1,7 then the clone won't be able to cover the entire segment. From dry running a few more test cases it becomes clear that we would have to put the clones in the peaks of the array because they are otherwise unreachable. We also will have to first compress the array such that consecutive equal elements are ommited as they don't affect the answer but might unnecessarily increase the peaks. So the final answer will be just the no of peaks in the compressed array.
