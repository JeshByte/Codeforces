So, first we will need to observe that n is too large. That means we will have to find our answer through the x given points only. We will have to first try to figure out how we need to draw the diagonals to get the maximum number of diagonals. We will see that once we have drawn all the necessary diagonals optimally we have basically drawn a x-sided inner polygon inside the already given polygon. And this inner polygon can have at most x-2 diagonals. In addition to this, we will see that some additional triangles are also being formed. Those will basically consist of 1 side from the inner polygon and 2 sides from the outer polygon. We will handle these triangles seperately and add them on to our final answer.
