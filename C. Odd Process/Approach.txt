First lets handle the edge cases. If there are only evens in the array, the answer will be all zeroes. On the other hand, if there are only odds in the array, the answer will be the highest odd number in the odd positions and 0 in the even positions. So now we need to deal with the arrays which have both of them. So the optimal strategy would be to first pick the highest odd number then one by one pick the highest even number left to fill all the remaining positions. This can be done till there are at least k-1 even nos for a particular k. When this would fail there would be these 2 cases - 
- We shift the arrangement we had till now to the end. We then see the no of remaining spots at the start. If they are even and we have enough odd numbers left we can achieve the same peak sum as before. If not, the answer for this k would be 0.
- If the no of remaining spots are odd, we can remove one even number from the end and shift the arrangement by one spot to make it even. If we have enough odd numbers, the answer for this k would be the (peak sum - the last even no that had been added). If we dont, here also the answer would be 0.
