First lets assume that we had 1d points instead. Then if we plotted them on a number line and divided them into two sections, we will get our answer by simply paring points of opposite sections. We will have to use this same idea in the case of 2d points too. We will divide the points into 4 quadrants - q1,q2,q3,q4. Then we will need to just pair the points of q1 and q3 together and similarly we will pair the points of q2 and q4. This will give us our optimal answer.
