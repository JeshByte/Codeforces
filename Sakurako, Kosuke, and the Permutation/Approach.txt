This is a permutation problem so we will have to use the approach of cycles/graphs. We can see that the permutation can be divided into various cycles. It is simple when each cycle has at most 2 numbers. In each swap we split a cycle into 2. So the answer is going to be the summation of individual operations needed for each cycle. For even length cycles, it is going to be length/2 - 1 or else its just length/2.
