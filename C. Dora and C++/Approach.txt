Let's first consider the case of a=b. Here, we can see that our final answer has to be <=a. This is because we will be always able to put all the elements of the array in between na to (n+1)a. So all the elements here would turn from x to x+na. So if we mod all the elements with a in both the cases we would get (x%a), which is the constant factor here. So we have to just consider the %a values for all the elements. But we have to consider another case here. Lets say after modding, the values are 0,1,3,4(let a=5). So the initial range is 4. But then we can increment 0 to 5 so it now becomes 1,3,4,5. So now the range is still 4. We will have to check like this for all the elements. After we have incremented all the elements once there is no use of more increments as it would become cylcic now. Now, for a!=b, we have to do something similar but here a=b=gcd(a,b). This is because now x will become x + n1a + n2b which can be shown as x + n1m1g +n2m2g where g is the gcd. Here modding with g will give us the constant factor. So we have to do the same thing but using g this time.
