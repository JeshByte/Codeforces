For a fixed x, from the formula we get that the number of points which satisfy the given condition are 2a+1 where a=sqrt(r^2-(x-xi)^2). Obviously for points which are inside multiple circles, we have to consider the contribution with the maximum a. To do that, we can simply go through each circle, and for each circle go through all the possible x's within it and compute it's contribution. We can maintain a max contribution for each point using a map. The complexity of this code will be n*(2*radius+1) which reduces to n*radius which further reduces to sum of radii which is m which as mentioned in the question is bounded to 2e5. Thus our solution would easily run within the given constraints.
