So, if we solve the given equation we can see that any two points xa,ya and xb,yb will satisfy the condition if xa=xb or ya=yb. Now the main challenge is to figure out how to create exactly k such pairs. Now if we have a series of points (x1,y),(x2,y),....(xn,y) then this will give us n(n-1)/2 pairs. It will not be possible to create exactly k pairs using this way. So what we can do is find the closest possible n for k using this formula. Then find the number of pairs we have created and minus it from k. Then we repeat this for the new k. This task can be done through a recursive function. We can also brute force it to prove that the number of points will never go beyond 500 thus we can safely use this method to solve the problem.
