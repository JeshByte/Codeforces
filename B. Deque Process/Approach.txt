Here, optimally while constructing an array you would want to alternate the parity with every new element. That means that lets say the current array is [a1,a2] such that a1<a2. Then you would want to put a3 such that a3>a2 and vice versa. So this is the condition that we would use to construct the array using the given operations. For every element we have 2 choices. If only one of them satisfy the condition, we would use that one. If both of them satisfy the condition, then depending on the current parity we will choose the element. Lets say we want to add a(i) such that a(i)>a(i-1). Then we would want a(i) to be as big as possible so that it would be easier to find a(i+1) such that a(i+1)<a(i). Similarly for the other type of parity, we will choose the minimum possible element. If none of the elements satisfy the condition then we will have to continue the same parity but we will follow a similar logic as above to make it easier to find an optimal next element. There is another factor to be considered. We have 4 possibilities for the first 2 elements. They can have 2 different parities. So for each parity, choose the best pair following the same logic as above such that finding the next optimal element is as easy as possible. Thus we will have 2 possible starting points and 2 different constructions. After we have constructed the final array following all the above conditions, just check whether it satisfies the given condition in the problem statement. If yes then this would be our anwer. As the problem guarantees an answer, at least one out of the 2 constructions will be valid.
