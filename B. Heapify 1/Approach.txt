In these kind of questions, where we can swap elements into certain positions based on a condition - there are only a fixed number of locations where the element can be swapped into. So here each element i should be in ith position. If it is in that position already, good. Otherwise we will see the positions that can be swapped with the ith position. If i is present in any one of these positions then it can be brought to its required position otherwise it is impossible. Now according to the condition, from i we can swap with i*2,i*4 and so on till it is <=(n/2). And also it can get swapped with by the postions (i/2),(i/4),... and so on till it is <=(n/2). This can be found in logn time. Thus in this way we can check if the array is sortable in nlogn time.
