We need to make the array sorted in increasing order. So obviosuly we would do this operation to make an element smaller than the next one if it happens to be greater. So what we can do is to make the elements as small as possible from the beginning. So we have to make each element such that it is larger than the previous one and smaller than the next one while being as small as possible using a bi from b. This amounts to an inequality so we can just use binary search to find the required element. After doing these operations we can just check if the final array is sorted or not. Also it may not be always necessary to perform the operation so we also need to handle that case.
