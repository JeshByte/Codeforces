As we can't round numbers here we have to ensure that the total sum is divisible by the number of elements and that the array is of odd lenth. So we go for the smallest possible odd length i.e. 3. So the 2nd element has to be b. Now mathematically we can find the sum of the remaining 2 numbers so that the mean is a. Let that sum be x. Now we need to ensure that these 2 numbers are such that one of them <=b and the other one is >=b with their sum also being equal to x. So a,b >=-100 & <=100 while we are allowed to use numbers whose absolute values is <=1e6. So we can put one number to be -1000 always. Then the other number will be x+1000. So the first number will always be less than b because of b's lower bound. While the other number will always be more than b irrespective of x's sign. So this pattern can be used to always find the answer.
