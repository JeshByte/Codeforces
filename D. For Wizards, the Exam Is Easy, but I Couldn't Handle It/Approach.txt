So, first of all it says in the question that n^2 is within the limits. So our soultion can go till n^2. Now in our problem we are dealing cyclic shift of subarrays. As n^2 is allowed, we can simply go through all the possible subarrays to find the optimal one. Now we have to consider how to determine the subarray where it would be most optimal to perform the shift. On dry running on some testcases, we can see that the shift operation only reduces the inversions from the first element of the concerned subarray. So, we can simply keep track of the inversions of the first element in the subarray. But theres another thing, this operation will also create new inversions. Say there is a subarray a,b,c,d. Here a>c and a>d whereas a<b. So on performing the shift, the subarray becomes - b,c,d,a. So now we reduced the two inversions but created a new one i.e b>a. Thus, we will have to keep track of the inversions that we remove and create for each operation to find the optimal one.
