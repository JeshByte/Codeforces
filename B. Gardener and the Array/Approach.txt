So the OR of a subsequence is basically the union of all the vectors in that subsequence. Our condition will be satisfied if all the elements that appear in our first subsequence have a frequency of greater than 1. Then we will know that there definitely exists a 2nd subsequence which will have these elements too. This idea then can be further simplified to just individual vectors. If all the elements of a vector have a frequency of greater than 1, then there is definitely some subsequence out there whose union will also have all these same elements and thus we will be able to satisfy our condition. Otherwise there is no answer.
