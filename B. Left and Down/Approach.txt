So here we would never need more than 2 coins. This is because if we at first only use (1,1) then end result will be either (0,0) or (x,0) or (0,y). In all of these cases, you will need at most one more pair to reach the destination. We just need to find out the case where the answer would be one. This would happen when there is a single pair which is enough to go till (0,0). Let this pair be (x,y). So here for it to satisfy our condition, x*c=a and y*c=b for some c. So this c has to divide both a and b and should be as large as possible so that x and y are as small as possible so that there is a higher chance that they are <=k. So c is basically going to be gcd(a,b). We will then just find x and y using c and check whether it is a valid answer or not. If it is, then it would be 1 coin or else we need 2 coins.
