In the given graph, two vertices have an edge if the smaller value comes before the larger value in the permutation. Similarly, if two vertices don't have an edge that means the larger value comes before the smaller value in the permutation. So we have the data for all the points on which other points come before and after it. Therefore we can just construct a DAG using this data and run a topological sort on it to find the required permutation(it is given that only a unique answer is possible so we don't need to worry about that).
