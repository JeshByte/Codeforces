We just need to identify the blocks in the array. So lets say we are currently checking for a block and we get this new element and we have to see if it can be included in the current block or not. If the new element is 1 more than the last element of the block, then it can be included in it. If it is equal to or less than the last element, then it can be included in the block only if an element 1 less than it is present in the block already(this element will generate our new element). And finally, if the new element is greater than the last element, there is no way it could be generated from any of the elements of the block, so it isnt included. We can keep track of the elements in the current block using a set. This way we will be able to find the no of blocks in the array which is our answer.
