So, the first thing to notice is that n goes till 1e7. This means that we can go upto a O(n) solution. So, we are supposed to find 2 numbers - a and b such that  their lcm/gcd is prime and a<b within 1-n. So simplifying the formula gives us lcm^2/a*b. So lets try to figure out that for different values of a what values of b could be paired with it. So initially I took cases of a being prime and non-prime. And then we can see that for whatever value of a it's valid pairs would be the multiples - a*2,a*3,a*5,a*7... i.e. its prime multiples. This can be easily done using sieve within the given constraints.
