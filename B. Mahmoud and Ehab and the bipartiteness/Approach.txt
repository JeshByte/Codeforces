So as it is a bipartite graph, lets assume that we are able to seperate the vertices into the 2 sets. Now the only edges that we cant make are the edges between the vertices in the same set. So for a set of size l1, the no of edges that are invalid are l1(l1-1)/2. Lets say the 2nd set is of size l2, so the invalid edges there are l2(l2-1)/2. Now for n nodes, the total possible edges that can be made are n(n-1)/2. n-1 edges are already given. So then the max no of edges that we can create without changing the bipartite property of the graph is -> n(n-1)/2 - (n-1) - l1(l1-1)/2 - l2(l2-1)/2. So the main challenge is now to find the 2 sets. This can be done using bfs in O(v+e) time. After that, we just have to use the above formula to find the answer.
