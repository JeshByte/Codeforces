So for the operation to work, both the numbers need to be of different parity. So if all the numbers in the array are of same parity then the answer will just be the maximum element. If not, then there are 2 cases.
1) If the maximum number is odd, then it can easily merge with all the even numbers. This is because the resultant number will always be odd so there won't be any problem in merging with an even number at any moment. But then the remaining odd numbers won't be utilised. So what we can do is reduce all the odd numbers to 1 and add it to the other even numbers. Then we can merge these larger updated even numbers with our maximum.
2) If the maximum number is even, it will have to initially merge with an odd number. But after this it would be same as the above case.
